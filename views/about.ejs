            Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) is the premier Research and Development (R&D) organization of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) for carrying out R&D in Information Technologies and Electronics (IT&E) and associated areas.  Different areas of C-DAC, had originated at different times, many of which came out as a result of identification of opportunities.

                        <p>The setting up of C-DAC in 1988 itself was to built Supercomputers in context of denial of import of Supercomputers by USA. Since then C-DAC has been undertaking building of multiple generations of Supercomputer starting from PARAM with 1 GF in 1988.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Almost at the same time, C-DAC started building Indian Language Computing Solutions with setting up of GIST group (Graphics and Intelligence based Script Technology); National Centre for Software Technology (NCST) set up in 1985 had also initiated work in Indian Language Computing around the same period.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Electronic Research and Development Centre of India (ER&DCI) with various constituents starting as adjunct entities of various State Electronic Corporations, had been brought under the hold of Department of Electronics and Telecommunications (now MeitY) in around 1988. They were focusing on various aspects of applied electronics, technology and applications.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>With the passage of time as a result of creative ecosystem that got set up in C-DAC, more areas such as Health Informatics, etc., got created; while right from the beginning the focus of NCST was on Software Technologies; similarly C-DAC started its education & training activities in 1994 as a spin-off with the passage of time, it grew to a large efforts to meet the growing needs of Indian Industry for finishing schools.</p>
